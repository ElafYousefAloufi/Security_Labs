All life is an experiment The more experiments you make the better
All of life is peaks and valleys Don’t let the peaks get too high and the valleys too low
However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at
The most important thing is to enjoy your life—to be happy—it’s all that matters
Life is short, and it is up to you to make it sweet
Life doesn’t require that we be the best, only that we try our best
The truth is you don’t know what is going to happen tomorrow Life is a crazy ride, and nothing is guaranteed
If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor
You’re only here for a short visit Don’t hurry, don’t worry And be sure to smell the flowers along the way
It doesn’t matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop
